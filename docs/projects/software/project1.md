# Crash

## Overview
**Problem:** Living alone as an intern or college student in a new city can be costly, intimidating, and lonely.

**Goal:** Design a solution that makes it easy for traveling professionals to find roommates, community, and housing at their travel destination.

**Solution:** Crash, a work community-based web platform connecting users to similar work travelers at their destination, and streamlining the process of forming living groups.

## Market Research

#### Studies
In February 2024, I was granted **$1,000** in seed funding by the [MIT Sandbox](https://sandbox.mit.edu/) to pursue Crash as a startup idea. Under the mentorship of entrepreneurial technologist Mitchell Ayoob, I conducted the following market research studies:
- Focus groups
- Survey
- 1:1 interviews
