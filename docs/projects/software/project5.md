## Overview
With a partner, I entered the 2024 [MIT Pokerbots](https://pokerbots.org/) competition. We applied concepts of computer science, math, and game theory to program a completely autonomous bot to play poker. Our bot was coded entirely in **Python**.

_This project submission was awarded Most Concise Bot by Hudson River Trading._
